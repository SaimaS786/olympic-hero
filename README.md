### Project Overview

 The project is all about the Olympic Games which is considered to be the world's foremost sports competition. It has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table),  look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of the Olympic Games.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of data handling with python (pandas) and how the panda operations are applied to get the required solution to the given problem.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

  In this project, I used the concepts of Dataframe operations, Conditional statements and loops, List operations, Bar Plotting and Mathematical operations.


### Challenges faced

 The 'Advanced Panda Operations ' topic was a bit tricky. But in the end I got the gist of it.
